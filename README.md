# ResumeChatbot
Developed a Rule and Machine Learning based chatbot for my resume using Flask, Python, NLP and hosted the web application on my personal Azure website for testing.
Rule Based engine uses Levenstein distance while Machine Learning based engine uses Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifiers to find question similarity.
